# 🐾 Astro Paws

_A cat. In space. Fighting lemons, cucumbers, and lizards. With hairballs._  
Because why not?

Astro Paws is a chaotic and cute space shooter built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Flame](https://flame-engine.org/). You play as a fearless feline soaring through the galaxy, obliterating veggie-reptilian enemies with furball artillery.

> ⚠️ Currently under development! Expect bugs, weirdness, and experimental cat physics.
